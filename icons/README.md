# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The recommended design is:

- Purple/gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- White "F" letter or flow symbol in the center
- Simple, minimalist design

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use any placeholder PNG files with the correct dimensions. The extension will still function without proper icons, but they won't display correctly in the browser.

## Quick Creation with Online Tools

Use online tools like:
- Canva
- Figma
- Photopea
- Or any image editor that supports PNG export
